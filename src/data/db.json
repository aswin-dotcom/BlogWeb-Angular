      "Body": "Angular is a popular open-source web application framework developed and maintained by Google. It allows developers to build dynamic, single-page applications (SPAs) with ease. Angular is built on TypeScript, which provides strong typing and modern JavaScript features, making the development process more robust and maintainable.\n\nOne of the key features of Angular is its component-based architecture, which encourages modular development. Components are reusable and can be combined to create complex user interfaces. Angular also includes powerful data-binding mechanisms, enabling synchronization between the model and the view, reducing the amount of boilerplate code.\n\nAngular's dependency injection system facilitates the management of services and improves code reusability and testing. The framework also provides a comprehensive set of tools for routing, form handling, HTTP client communication, and more. Additionally, Angular's CLI (Command Line Interface) simplifies project setup, development, and deployment by offering built-in commands for scaffolding, testing, and building applications.\n\nWith its extensive ecosystem, strong community support, and regular updates from Google, Angular continues to be a preferred choice for developers building scalable and high-performance web applications.
